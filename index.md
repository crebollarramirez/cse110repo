# About Me

**Name: Christopher Rebollar-Ramirez** \
I love to program in C++ and in Python. I also love cats. Here are some of my favorite things about cats.

This is the first line of code I have ever written.
```
std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl
```
> The first language I learned was C++. I then went on in learning Python, Java, and database languages.

## Anyways, here are pictures and information I like about cats

### Siamese Cat
